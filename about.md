## Welcome to my e-portfolio

Hello there,

My name is Lutero. I am a student at the University of Essex, completing my MSc in Enterprise IT Management.
As part of my studies, I was tasked to create an e-portfolio. I am an information and communications technology (ICT) professional working with the United Nations in Mozambique. I am driven by a deep sense of purpose, which is to make a positive impact on the lives of vulnerable populations affected by crises. I find fulfilment in leveraging Telecommunications and ICT solutions to support program implementation and deliver life-saving services.

Iâ€™m reachable through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lutero-malunga-b9750296/).
